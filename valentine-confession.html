                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I’ve been thinking about something since the day we met at Junction Square with Shune and Hazel. It was unexpected, but spending time with you that day made me really happy. From walking around to playing games together, those moments stayed on my mind even now.

To be honest, I didn’t expect to feel this way, but I started to like you more than just as a friend. Your presence, your smile, and the way we enjoyed that day together made a strong impression on me. I haven’t been able to forget it.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>

I’m sharing this because I don’t want to hide my feelings. I truly like you, and I wanted to tell you sincerely. I understand if you need time or if you don’t feel the same, but I wanted you to know how I feel.

Thank you for the memories from that day. No matter what your answer is, I’m glad I met you.
